There are many modules that need to be downloaded to get this going:
> sudo apt-get install fswebcam libav-tools imagemagick v4l-utils

Explained in detail here if you want:
avconv - https://libav.org/avconv.html
fswebcam - http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/trusty/man1/fswebcam.1.html
v4l-utils - https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=62364
imagemagick - http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/

I used the instructions from here to put it all together:

Credits to each of the authors - it helped immensily for getting this project off the ground.
