There are many mmodules that need to be downloaded to get this going:

avconv - https://libav.org/avconv.html
fswebcam - http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/trusty/man1/fswebcam.1.html
v4l-utils - 
imagemagick - 
I used the instructions from here to put it all together:

Credits to each of the authors - it helped immensily for getting this project off the ground.
